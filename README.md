# Installing IE 10

First, make sure you have the VirtualBox installed locally. Visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and install the latest version.

Then run the following script from the command line:

    $ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/translationexchange/trex-utils/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS='10' bash 
  

Finally, open the VirtualBox and run the IE 10 Virtual machine.
